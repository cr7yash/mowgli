# "Mowgli vs Evil Snails" game

Lives here: https://mowgli-game-app.herokuapp.com/ . Just click (mouse click / touch screen) to jump.

I created this game using the pixi.js library for graphic rendering, and React for game logic control. For linking these libraries I used react-pixi-fiber, which imposed some restrictions.  In general, my conclusion is that these games probably is better to make without React, but I do not regret this experiment :)


Used:
* pixi.js;
* Create-React-App (ejected because of some issues);
* react-pixi-fiber
