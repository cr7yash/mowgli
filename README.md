#"Mowgli vs Evil Snails" game

After spending a few evenings learning (just for fun) how to make html5 interactive games, I created this game using the pixi.js library for graphic rendering, and React for game status control. For linking these libraries I used react-pixi-fiber, which imposed some restrictions.  In general, my conclusion is that these games are easier to make without React, but I do not regret this experiment :)

Used:
* pixi.js;
* Create-React-App (ejected because of some issues);
* react-pixi-fiber

P.S I not planned to spend a lot of time working on it, so game may have some bugs and is not adapted for all screen sizes.
